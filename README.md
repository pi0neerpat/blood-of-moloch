This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Keyp Setup

1. Copy the file `.sample-env` to `.env`
2. Create a new application on on https://dev.usekeyp.com.

- Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/keyp` (note that your port may be different). Ready for production? Make sure to upate this to eg. `https://my-site.com/api/auth/callback/keyp`.
- Copy the "CLIENT ID" for your application and set it to `KEYP_CLIENT_ID` in `.env`

3. In the `.env`, set `TOKEN_SECRET` to a random string, which is used for `next-auth` session cookies. You can generate this using `openssl rand -base64 32`. (NOTE: Do not use your access token here)
